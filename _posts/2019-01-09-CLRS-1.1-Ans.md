# Intro To Algorithms Answers 1.1
1. An example of a convex hull in real life is trying to enclose a group of trees given all the points of the trees.

2. Memory usage, CPU utilization

3. Balanced Binary Search Tree (Red-Black Trees or AVL)

		Advantages:
        1. O(log n) for an n height tree when doing an insertion, deletion, or search
        2. Easily get all the data in order
        Disadvantages:
        1. Tedious to implement

4. The traveling salesman problem and the shortest path both want to achieve the max amount of work in the most efficent way. They differ in the traveling salesman problem gets the least weight for a whole path, while shortest path does it between only two vertices.

5. The best solution is needed when we are driving a car and the car ahead of us stops, our car needs to stop as well. An approximate solution is needed when buying groceries, if a little food is leftover, it can be used later or thrown away. But it does not endanger anyone's lives.
