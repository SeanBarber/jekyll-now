Over the next few weeks I am going to be going through [The Introduction To Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844) and I will try and post my solutions on here, or if they are code based on github and then share the link on here. At the same time I am going to try and implement all the algorithms in Swift.

Hopefully, I can create a library with all of the algorithms to save people some time.
