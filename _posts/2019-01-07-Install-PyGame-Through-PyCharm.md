I am trying to dabble with PyGame to maybe make some basic games.

I brought up the following [tutorial](https://www.raywenderlich.com/2795-beginning-game-programming-for-teens-with-python) and started following it.

I proceeded to try and pip install pygame the way that is [recommended on their website](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted)

This did not work and after multiple google searches, none of the StackOverflow posts fixed my problem. Although one did recommend to use PyCharm but then did not provide info on how to actuall install libraries.

So I downloaded [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/), being a JetBrains project resembles Android Studio. I have always enjoyed working in Android Studio.

Once you have PyCharm downloaded, open it up and go through the installation process.

At this point you can create a project.

Once you have created a project, select Preferences under the PyCharm tab

Then select Project: theNameOfYourProject

Then select project interpreter

In the lower left there is an addition symbol, click it.

Now a search bar appears, type PyGame

Select the PyGame and click Install Package

Now to test what you did was correct, go to the Python Console and type
```
import pygame
```
